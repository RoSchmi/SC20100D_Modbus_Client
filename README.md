# SC20100D_Modbus_Client

Modbus TCP Client example for TinyCLR V2 Board GHI SC20100D 

The example came up as a fix in response to this thread of @WombatWonder
He noticed that the a Modbus Slave created with TiniClr library v2.0.0 answered only on the first modbus request, not on succeeding requests
